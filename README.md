## 🧠 Code Overview

```python
# Core stopwatch logic
def update_stopwatch():
    global counter
    if running:
        minutes, seconds = divmod(counter, 60)
        hours, minutes = divmod(minutes, 60)
        label.config(text=f"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}:{seconds:02d}")
        counter += 1
        root.after(1000, update_stopwatch)
```

The timer updates every 1 second (`1000ms`) using `root.after`, and displays formatted time in `HH:MM:SS`.
